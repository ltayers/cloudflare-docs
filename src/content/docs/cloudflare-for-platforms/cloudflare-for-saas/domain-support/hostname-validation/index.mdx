Before Cloudflare can proxy traffic through a custom hostname, we need to verify your customer's ownership of that hostname.

:::note
If a custom hostname is already on Cloudflare, using the [pre-validation methods](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/pre-validation/) will not shift the traffic to the SaaS zone. That will only happen once the [DNS target](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#3-have-customer-create-cname-record) of the custom hostnames changes to point to the SaaS zone.
:::

## Options

If minimizing downtime is more important to you, refer to our [pre-validation methods](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/pre-validation/).

If ease of use for your customers is more important, review our [real-time validation methods](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/realtime-validation/).

## Limitations

Custom hostnames using another CDN are not compatible with Cloudflare for SaaS. Since Cloudflare must be able to validate your customer's ownership of the hostname you add, if their usage of another CDN obfuscates their DNS records, hostname validation will fail.
