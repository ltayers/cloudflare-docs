---

When you [validate a custom hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/), that hostname can be in several different statuses.

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Blocked             | Custom hostname cannot be added to Cloudflare at this time. Custom hostname was likely associated with Cloudflare previously and flagged for abuse.<br/><br/>If you are an Enterprise customer, contact your Customer Success Manager. Otherwise, email `abusereply@cloudflare.com` with the name of the web property and a detailed explanation of your association with this web property. |
| Moved               | Custom hostname is not active after **Pending** for the entirety of the [Validation Backoff Schedule](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/backoff-schedule/) or it no longer points to the fallback origin.                                                                                                                                     |
| Deleted             | Custom hostname was deleted from the zone. Occurs when status is **Moved** for more than seven days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Refresh validation

To run the custom hostname validation check again, select **Refresh** on the dashboard or send a `PATCH` request to the [Edit custom hostname endpoint](/api/resources/custom_hostnames/methods/edit/). If using the API, make sure that the `--data` field contains an `ssl` object with the same `method` and `type` as the original request.

If the hostname is in a **Moved** or **Deleted** state, the refresh will set the custom hostname back to **Pending validation**.
