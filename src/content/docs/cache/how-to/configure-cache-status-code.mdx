Customers can set cache time-to-live (TTL) based on the response status from the origin web server. Cache TTL refers to the duration of a resource in the Cloudflare network before being marked as `STALE` or discarded from cache. Status codes are returned by a resource's origin.

Setting cache TTL based on response status overrides the [default cache behavior (standard caching)](/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/) for static files and overrides cache instructions sent by the origin web server. To cache non-static assets, set a [Cache Level of Cache Everything using a Cache Rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-api/#example-requests). Setting `no-store` **Cache-Control** or a low TTL (using `max-age`/`s-maxage`) increases requests to origin web servers and decreases performance.

## Caching limits

The maximum caching limit for Free, Pro, and Business customers is 512 MB per file, and the maximum caching limit for Enterprise customers is 5 GB per file. If you need to raise the limits, contact your Customer Success Manager.

## Edge TTL

By default, Cloudflare caches certain HTTP response codes with the following Edge Cache TTL when a `cache-control` directive or `expires` response header are not present.

| HTTP status code | Default TTL |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| 200, 206, 301    | 120m        |
| 302, 303         | 20m         |
| 404, 410         | 3m          |

All other status codes are not cached by default.

## Set cache TTL by response status via the Cloudflare dashboard

To set cache TTL by response status, [create a Cache Rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) for [**Cache TTL by status code**](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#edge-ttl).

## Set cache TTL by response status via the Cloudflare API

```bash title="Request"
curl --request PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{

      "action": "set_cache_settings",
      "action_parameters": {

              },
              "value": 86400
            },
            {

                "from": 300,
                "to": 499
              },
              "value": 0  // no-cache
            },
            {
              "status_code_range": {
                "from": 500
              },
              "value": -1  // no-store
            }
          ],
          "mode": "respect_origin"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

### Syntax

Provide a JSON object containing status codes and their corresponding TTLs. Each key-value pair in the cache TTL by status cache rule has the following syntax:

* `status_code`: An integer value such as 200 or 500. `status_code` matches the exact status code from the origin web server. Valid status codes are between 100-999.
* `status_code_range`: Integer values for `from` and `to`. `status_code_range` matches any status code from the origin web server within the specified range.
* `value`: An integer value that defines the duration an asset is valid in seconds or one of the following strings: `no-store` (equivalent to `-1`), `no-cache` (equivalent to `0`).

## Set cache TTL by response status via a Cloudflare Worker

The **cacheTtlByStatus** option is a version of the **cacheTtl** feature that designates a cache TTL for a request’s response status code (for example, `{ "200-299": 86400, 404: 1, "500-599": 0 }`).

## TTL handling for 304 and 200 status codes

1. If a TTL is not explicitly set for status code `304`, we automatically set it to match the TTL of status code `200` (if the user has defined one for `200`).

2. If a user explicitly sets a different TTL for `304` than for `200`, the following behavior will occur:

- When a `200` response is received, the asset is cached with the TTL specified for status `200`.
- Once the asset expires and we revalidate with the origin, if the origin returns a `304`, the cache TTL is updated to the value set for `304`.

For example, if a user specifies a TTL of one hour for status `200` and 0 seconds (cache and always revalidate) for status `304`, the asset will be cached for 1 hour. After it expires, we revalidate with the origin. If the origin returns a `304`, each subsequent request will trigger revalidation. If the origin continues to return `304`, this cycle will persist.

This behavior is likely undesirable unless the user has a specific use case. Therefore, users should ensure that the TTL for `304` matches the TTL for `200` unless they intentionally require this behavior.
